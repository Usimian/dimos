"""Audio pipeline framework (audio2).

Modern reactive audio pipeline built on GStreamer and RxPY.

Architecture:
  - Raw PCM F32LE is the standard internal format
  - Inputs decode to raw, outputs encode from raw
  - All data flows through RxPY observables

Basic usage:
    >>> from dimos.stream.audio2 import signal, robotize, speaker
    >>> signal(frequency=440, duration=2.0).pipe(robotize(), speaker()).run()

Text-to-speech:
    >>> from dimos.stream.audio2 import openai_tts, speaker
    >>> openai_tts("Hello world").pipe(speaker()).run()

Modules:
    - input: Audio sources (file, microphone, signal, TTS)
    - operators: Audio transformations (effects, normalizer, vumeter)
    - output: Audio sinks (speaker, network)
    - types: Core data types (AudioEvent, AudioSpec, AudioFormat)
